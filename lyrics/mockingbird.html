    Yeah
    I know sometimes things may not
    Always make sense to you right now
    But hey, what daddy always tell you?
    Straighten up little soldier
    Stiffen up that upper lip
    What you crying about?
    You got me
    Hailie, I know you miss your mom
    And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
    But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
    I can see you're sad
    Even when you smile
    Even when you laugh
    I can see it in your eyes
    Deep inside, you wanna cry
    'Cause you're scared
    I ain't there?
    Daddy's with you in your prayers
    No more crying
    Wipe them tears
    Daddy's here
    No more nightmares
    We gonna pull together through it
    We gon' do it
    Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
    Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
    We're all we got in this world
    When it spins
    When it swirls
    When it whirls
    When it twirls
    Two little beautiful girls
    Looking puzzled, in a daze
    I know it's confusing you
    Daddy's always on the move
    Mama's always on the news
    I try to keep you sheltered from it
    But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
    The more it backfires on me
    All the things, growing up
    As daddy that he had to see
    Daddy don't want you to see
    But you see just as much as he did
    We did not plan it to be this way
    Your mother and me
    But things have got so bad between us
    I don't see us ever being together ever again
    Like we used to be when was teenagers
    But then of course
    Everything always happens for a reason
    I guess it was never meant to be
    But it's just something
    We have no control over
    And that's what destiny is
    But no more worries
    Rest your head and go to sleep
    Maybe one day we'll wake up
    And this will all just be a dream
    Now hush little baby don't you cry
    Everything's gonna be alright
    Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
    I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
    Through the night
    I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
    We fear how we feel inside
    It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
    But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
    It's funny
    I remember back one year when daddy had no money
    Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
    And stuck 'em under the tree
    And said some of them were from me
    'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
    I'll never forget that Christmas
    I sat up the whole night cryin'
    'Cause daddy felt like a bum
    See daddy had a job
    But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
    And at the time, every house that we lived in
    Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
    And your mom, was saving money
    For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
    So you can go to college
    Almost had a thousand dollars
    'Til someone broke in and stole it
    And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
    And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
    Mom and dad was arguing a lot
    So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
    One bedroom apartment
    And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
    And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
    And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
    But daddy had to work
    You and mama had to leave me
    Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
    And mama didn't like it
    And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
    Papa was a rolling stone
    Mama developed a habit
    And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
    I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
    'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
    Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
    Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
    To see how much you both have grown
    It's almost like your sisters now
    Wow, I guess you pretty much are
    And daddy's still here
    Lainie I'm talking to you too
    Daddy's still here
    I like the sound of that, yeah
    It's got a ring to it, don't it?
    Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
    Now hush little baby don't you cry
    Everything's gonna be alright
    Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
    I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
    Through the night
    I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
    We fear how we feel inside
    It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
    But I promise
    Mama's gonna be alright
    And if you ask me to
    Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
    I'ma give you the world
    I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
    I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
    And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
    I'ma break that birdy's neck
    I'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya
    And make him eat every carat
    Don't fuck with dad, haha</pre></div>
