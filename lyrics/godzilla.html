    Ugh, you're a monster
    I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
    Better hit the deck like the card dealer
    My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
    A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby
    The Brain Heenan which is probably the
    Same reason I wrestle with mania
    Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
    Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
    If they sleepin' on me, the
    Hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, hydroxycut
    Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)
    In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
    Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
    This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, h-a, h-a, h-a
    Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames
    They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)
    Monster
    You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
    I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)
    When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
    I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
    Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
    Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
    Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
    Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
    I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
    Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
    It's impossible to list 'em all
    And in the midst of all this
    I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
    Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
    Risperdal, voices whisper
    But my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
    This is just the song to go ballistic on
    You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
    I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
    Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
    When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
    Monster
    You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
    I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)
    When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
    I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
    Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
    Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
    Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
    Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
    If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
    'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
    I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
    The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('xam)
    How can I have all these fans and perspire?
    Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
    And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
    These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
    I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers
    What goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
    'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
    Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
    Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
    'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake)
    Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
    Won't even lend you an ear ain't even pretendin' to care
    But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
    Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
    Christian Rivera '
    'Cause my lyrics never sit well so they wanna give me the chair
    Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
    'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
    Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
    Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
    It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
    We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
    Get the shaft out like a steering column (Mark Jack)
    Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
    Evil half of the Bad Meets
    Evil, that means take a back seat
    Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
    Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
    Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
    I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
    Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
    Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
    I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
    I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
    I'm finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in a lake
    Obliteratin' everything, incineratin' and renegade 'em
    And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
    But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway
    'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
    I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla
    You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
    You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
    Who went in me, and be on the recieving of me, what stupidity, it'd be
    Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
    When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
    Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
    A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
    I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
    You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
    I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
    I'm on the toilet bowl
    I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
    I'm not afraid to pull the
    Man stop
    Look what I'm plannin' (Haha)</pre></div>
