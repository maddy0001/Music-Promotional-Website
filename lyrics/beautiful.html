   <pre>
    Lately, I've been hard to reach
    I've been too long on my own
    Everybody has a private world
    Where they can be alone
    Are you calling me?
    Are you trying to get through?
    Are you reaching out for me?
    Then I'm reaching out for you
    I'm just so fuckin' depressed
    I just can't seem to get out this slump
    If I could just get over this hump
    But I need something to pull me out this dump
    I took my bruises, took my lumps
    Fell down and I got right back up
    But I need that spark to get psyched back up
    In order for me to pick the mic back up
    I don't know how or why or when
    And I ended up in this position I'm in
    I'm starting to feel distant again
    So I decided just to pick this pen
    Up and tried to make an attempt to vent
    But I just can't admit
    Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
    I need a new outlet
    And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
    But I just can't sit back and wallow
    In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    One tough act to follow
    I'll be one tough act to follow
    Here today, gone tomorrow
    But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what I'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (yeah, so)
    I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
    Everything's so tense and gloom
    I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
    Of the room, just as soon as
    I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
    So I try to avoid any eye contact
    'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
    For conversation like I want that
    I'm not looking for extra attention
    I just wanna be just like you
    Blend in with the rest of the room
    Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
    I don't need no fucking manservant
    Tryna follow me around, and wipe my ass
    Laugh at every single joke I crack
    And half of 'em ain't even funny like
    "Ha, Marshall, you're so funny, man
    You should be a comedian, goddamn"
    Unfortunately I am
    I just hide behind the tears of a clown
    So why don't you all sit down
    Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
    Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
    And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what I'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Nobody asked for life to deal us
    With these bullshit hands we're dealt
    We gotta take these cards ourselves
    And flip 'em, don't expect no help
    Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
    Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
    And get up and get my own
    I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
    Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
    For a dad to show up who never did
    I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
    I dreamed of being that cool kid
    Even if it meant acting stupid
    Aunt Edna always told me
    "Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that"
    Meanwhile, I'm just standing there
    Holding my tongue, trying to talk like this
    'Til I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
    I learned my lesson then
    'Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
    But I already told you my whole life story
    Not just based on my description
    'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
    Is probably 110% different
    I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
    What size you wear? I wear 10's
    Let's see if you can fit your feet
    In my shoes, just to see
    What it's like to be me
    I'll be you, let's trade shoes
    Just to see what I'd be like to
    Feel your pain, you feel mine
    Go inside each other's minds
    Just to see what we find
    Look at shit through each other's eyes
    But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful (oh)
    They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)
    Lately, I've been hard to reach
    I've been too long on my own (oh)
    Everybody has a private world
    Where they can be alone (so)
    Are you calling me?
    Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
    Are you reaching out for me?
    Then I'm reaching out for you (so)
    Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
    Dad'll be home soon
    And to the rest of the world
    God gave you them shoes to fit you
    So put 'em on and wear 'em
    Be yourself, man
    Be proud of who you are
    Even if it sounds corny
    Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful (so)</pre></div>
