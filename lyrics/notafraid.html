   <pre>
    I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah)
    To take a stand, it's been a ride
    Everybody, I guess I had to
    Go to that place
    To get to this one
    Now some of you
    Might still be in that place
    If you're tryin' to get out
    Just follow me
    I'll get you there
    You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
    But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
    'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
    When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
    I don't give a damn what you think
    I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
    It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
    I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
    And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
    No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
    From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
    Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
    Whichever comes first, for better or worse
    He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
    His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
    And fuck the whole universe
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that, you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
    I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
    You said you was king
    You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
    Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
    I'll never let you down again, I'm back
    I promise to never go back on that promise
    In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
    Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
    Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
    All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
    It's a game called circle and I don't know how
    I'm way too up to back down
    But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
    Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
    Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
    These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (everybody)
    Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that, you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
    And I just can't keep living this way
    So starting today
    I'm breaking out of this cage
    I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
    I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
    I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
    Time to put my life back together right now (now)
    It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
    Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
    For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
    And don't realize what you did, believe me you
    I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
    I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
    My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
    No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
    I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
    So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
    You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
    I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
    And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
    I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
    I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
    To take a stand (to take a stand)
    Everybody (Everybody)
    Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
    We'll walk this road together, through the storm
    Whatever weather, cold or warm
    Just letting you know that, you're not alone
    Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road</pre></div>
