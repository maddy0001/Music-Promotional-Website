   <pre>
    I've been a liar, been a thief
    Been a lover, been a cheat
    All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
    Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
    If all it's gonna cause is pain
    Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
    So let the river run
    He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
    Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
    On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
    And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
    It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
    She's kept track of all his Internet chats
    And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
    Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
    'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
    And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
    But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
    Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
    So she's been on the web lately
    Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
    And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
    Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
    After the first night, but tonight I am
    I've been a liar, been a thief
    Been a lover, been a cheat
    All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
    Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
    If all it's gonna cause is pain
    The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
    So let the river run
    A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
    It was "come sunlight, scram, " now we hug tight, and
    He found out, now she feels deserted and used
    'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
    Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
    It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
    Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
    Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
    So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
    Don't have to be reserved in a booth
    I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
    Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
    And now that I got you I don't want you
    Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
    Why do I do this dirt that I do?
    Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
    Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
    'Cause now with her in the womb
    We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
    To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit (Fuck!)
    I've been a liar, been a thief
    Been a lover, been a cheat
    All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
    Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
    If all it's gonna cause is pain
    The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
    So let the river run
    My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
    River (ooh), river run
    Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
    River (ooh), we'll let the river run
    Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
    Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
    And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
    Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
    That's why I may have came at you sideways
    I can't keep my lies straight
    But I made you terminate my baby
    This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
    What else can I say? It was fun for a while
    Bet I really woulda loved your smile
    Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
    What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
    I've been a liar, been a thief
    Been a lover, been a cheat
    All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
    Well, little one (I'm sorry)
    I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
    If all it's gonna cause is pain
    The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
    So let the river run</pre></div>
