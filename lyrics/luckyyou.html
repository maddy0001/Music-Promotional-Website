   <pre>        
        Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
        I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
        All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
        I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
        Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
        I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
        Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
        Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
        Fuck you too, woah!
        Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
        Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
        Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
        Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
        Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
        Turn my back on you all and you're finished
        Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
        Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
        Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
        These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
        Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
        You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
        I'm actually buzzin' this time
        Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
        I do not fuck with you guys
        If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
        I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
        Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
        Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
        My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
        I, run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)
        They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)
        I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
        Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo
        You play your cards, I reverse on you all
        And I might just draw four like a Uno
        Cállate boca mejor maricón little puto, and all of you culo
        They debated the level, I've been to ghetto to ghetto
        Looking for something I prolly could never find now
        Shit get real up until the beef die down
        In truth a nigga just really want me tied down
        I've been alone, and I never needed nobody
        Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
        Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
        I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
        I said ain't no love for the other side
        Or anyone who ever want smoke
        When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
        You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
        Nigga wrong way, wrong road
        Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
        I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
        I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
        This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
        I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
        Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
        Fuck's the difference?
        I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
        Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
        I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full
        I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me
        Fuck you think? (Woo!)
        I got a couple of mansions
        Still I don't have any manners
        You got a couple of ghost writers
        But to these kids it don't actually matter
        They're askin' me "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
        I said "I don't have any answers"
        'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
        It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
        And actually coming from humble beginnings
        I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
        I wish I could say "What a wonderful feeling!"
        We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling
        But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
        To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility
        Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'
        Songs about nothin' and mumble!
        And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
        Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
        Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
        About the ones that were here before you that made rap, let's recap
        Way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
        ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
        We need 3 Stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back
        Because half of these rappers have brain damage
        All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
        I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
        But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat that would take that
        Feedback and aim back, I need that
        But I think it's inevitable
        They know what button to press or what lever to pull
        To get me the snap though (lil' bitch)
        And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger
        But you've been takin' the dicks
        In the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)
        On the brink, any minute
        Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
        With acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
        I'm asleep at the wheel again
        As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
        Of another beat, I'ma kill again
        'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
        Even ketamine or methamphetamine
        With the minithin, it better be at least 70 to 300 milligram
        And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
        Levels to this shit I got an elevator
        You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
        I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
        Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
        Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way
        I got spite inside my DNA
        But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
        It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
        Like California wishin' rain would pour
        And that drought y'all have been prayin' for
        My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
        Still the same Marshall that outlaw
        That they say as a writer might've fell off
        I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
        So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move
        Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
        Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
        Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice</pre></div>
