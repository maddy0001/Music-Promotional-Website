    Look
    If you had
    One shot
    Or one opportunity
    To seize everything you ever wanted
    In one moment
    Would you capture it
    Or just let it slip?
    Yo
    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
    He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
    The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity
    Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked
    He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
    He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
    It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
    He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better
    His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
    This world is mine for the taking
    Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
    A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem
    It only grows harder, only grows hotter
    He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
    Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
    Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
    These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
    They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
    So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
    Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better
    No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
    I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
    I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
    But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
    Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
    All the pain inside amplified by the
    Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
    Five and I can't provide the right type of
    Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
    And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
    This is my life and these times are so hard
    And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
    Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
    Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
    For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
    Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
    To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
    Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
    So here I go, is my shot
    Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
    You better
    You can do anything you set your mind to, man</pre></div>
