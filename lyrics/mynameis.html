    Hi!
    My name is
    What?
    My name is
    Who?
    My name is
    Chika-chika
    Slim Shady
    Hi!
    My name is
    Huh?
    My name is
    What?
    My name is
    Chika-chika
    Slim Shady
    Hi!
    My name is
    What?
    Excuse me
    Can I have the attention of the class
    For one second
    Hi kids!
    Do you like violence?
    Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids?
    Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
    Try acid and get fucked up worse that my life is?
    My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
    But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
    And Dr. Dre said
    "Slim Shady you a base-head!"
    Uh-uh!
    "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
    Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
    'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
    Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
    And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
    I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
    Who sat down too fast
    Come here, slut!
    "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
    I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!
    Hi!
    My name is
    What?
    My name is
    Who?
    My name is
    Chika-chika
    Slim Shady
    Hi!

    Hi!
    My name is
    Huh?
    My name is
    What?
    My name is
    Chika-chika
    Slim Shady
    My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
    Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty five
    I smacked him in his face with an eraser
    Chased him with a stapler
    Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
    Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
    Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
    Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
    While they screamin' at me
    "Let's just be friends!"
    Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
    I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
    I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
    Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
    You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
    Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
    This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
    So I signed it
    "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"
    Hi!
    My name is
    What?

    Stop the tape!
    This kid needs to be locked away!
    Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
    I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
    I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
    Am I comin' or goin'?
    I can barely decide
    I just drank a fifth of vodka
    Dare me to drive?
    All my life I was very deprived
    I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
    Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
    I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
    When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
    How you gonna breast feed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
    I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
    With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
    I'm steamin' mad
    And by the way when you see my dad?
    Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had
    Hi!
    My name is
    What?
