   <pre>
    I am phenomenal
    With every ounce of my blood
    With every breath in my lungs
    Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
    I am phenomenal
    However long that it takes
    I'll go to whatever lengths
    It's gonna make me a monster though
    I am phenomenal
    But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
    Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
    Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
    Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
    When the going got rough
    Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
    Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
    There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
    The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
    Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
    Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
    Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
    But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
    Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
    Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
    Into waters where nobody else has gone before
    Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
    Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
    Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...
    I am phenomenal
    With every ounce of my blood
    With every breath in my lungs
    Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
    I am phenomenal
    However long that it takes
    I'll go to whatever lengths
    It's gonna make me a monster though
    I am phenomenal
    But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
    Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
    Let me self-empower you
    When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
    And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
    I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
    Convert it to gunpowder too
    Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
    Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
    Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
    Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
    Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
    Never take back what you say
    If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
    Ready to scrap asap
    Take your fists and just ball it
    Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
    Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
    Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
    And set it on 'em like a placemat
    (I am phenomenal)
    And I want you to say that
    I am phenomenal
    With every ounce of my blood
    With every breath in my lungs
    Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
    I am phenomenal
    However long that it takes
    I'll go to whatever lengths
    It's gonna make me a monster though
    I am phenomenal
    But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
    Cause I'm born to be phenomenal
    Step into the unknown and find yourself
    You're floating freely, no emotion
    Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve
    Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
    Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
    Cause I worked my butt off now
    It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
    Cause I stuck it out
    Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around
    You're gonna have non-believers
    But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
    Get it how you live
    But are you prepared to give more than you get?
    And put in twice what you get back from this shit
    Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
    Rap is my shiv
    But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
    Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
    How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
    Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
    Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
    Look what I have built, reputation is validation
    The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
    Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
    Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
    That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
    Your legend is makin' an allegation
    I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
    As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
    Managed to prove who the best man is
    Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing
    In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
    Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
    Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
    I am phenomenal
    With every ounce of my blood
    With every breath in my lungs
    Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
    I am phenomenal
    However long that it takes
    I'll go to whatever lengths
    It's gonna make me a monster though
    I am phenomenal
    But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible'
    Cause I'm born to be phenomenal</pre></div>
