    I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
    When the world gives you a raw deal
    Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
    When it talks to you like you don't belong
    Or tells you you're in the wrong field
    When something's in your mitochondrial
    'Cause it latched on to you, like—
    Knock knock, let the devil in
    Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
    This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
    L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
    Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
    Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
    Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
    Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
    Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
    And blew up my-my-myself again
    Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
    Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
    Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
    How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
    Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
    Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
    And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
    And I know they're gonna hate
    But I don't care, I barely can wait
    To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
    Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
    Because they're gonna taste my—
    Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm
    Ever gonna slow up and I'm
    Ready to snap any moment I'm
    Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
    (W-W-When they get bit with the—)
    Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm
    Ever gonna slow up and I'm
    Ready to snap any moment I'm
    Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
    (W-W-When they get bit with the—)
    I said knock knock, let the devil in
    Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
    Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
    It-it's evident I'm not done
    V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
    Like a web and you just caught in 'em
    Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
    Beat strangler attack
    So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
    Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
    Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
    Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
    Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
    My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
    With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
    Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
    Translation, I will probably kill us both
    When I end up backin' into ya
    You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
    When you're bit with the—
    Venom, adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm
    Ever gonna slow up and I'm
    Ready to snap any moment I'm
    Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
    (W-W-When they get bit with the—)
    Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm
    Ever gonna slow up and I'm
    Ready to snap any moment I'm
    Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
    (W-W-When they get bit with the—)
    I said knock knock, let the devil in
    Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
    Ain't no telling when this chokehold
    On this game will end, I'm loco
    Became a Symbiote, so
    My fangs are in your throat, ho
    You're snake-bitten with my—venom
    With the ballpoint pen I'm
    Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
    Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
    Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
    Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
    'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
    Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
    Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
    Chased it with straight liquor
    Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
    And awake with a headache
    And I take anything in rectangular shape
    Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
    'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
    So escapin' me is impossible
    I latch onto you like a—parasite
    And I probably ruined your parents' life
    And your childhood too
    'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
    I'm responsible for you retarded fools
    I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
    You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
    And I'm the suit, so call me—
    Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm
    Ever gonna slow up and I'm
    Ready to snap any moment I'm
    Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
    (W-W-When they get bit with the—)
    Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
    And I'm not knowin' when I'm

    They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
